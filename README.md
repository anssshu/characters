This is a godot project for creating a kinematic character finite state machine player template 
 
the player does not contain animation 

the dir objects/player contains all player related files

the dir objects/fsm contains a very basic state machine for understanding the concept of a state machine

The player is a kinematic body 2d and contains a state machine 
with  multiple states

1 idle
2 run
3 jump
4 attack
5 slide
6 fall
7 wall_jump
8 swim
9 die

It can used as a very good starting point for any game character
